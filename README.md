# Fraction-Calculator
a command line calculator in JS
The calculator takes its input as arguments from the command line,
which consists of 6 arithmetic operators.
The calculator performs the required arithmetical operation and
returns the answer as output to the console. All JS arithmetic operators are supported. 

Try it with the following input:
node js-calculator.js 1 6
Any ideas on how I can make it more fun?
